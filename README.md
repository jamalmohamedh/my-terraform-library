## My Codes on Terraform to perform various task in AWS Environment
1. Code to create EC2 instance which will have a shut down behavior. Note: I have used Amazon Linux AMI 2. For different AMI, Change the AMIID.  I have declared AMI in variable so any no. of instances can be initiated with the variable and to avoid copy paste of AMI ID every time.
